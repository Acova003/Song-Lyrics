# SongLyrics

Welcome to the song_lyrics gem! In this program, we are displaying a catalogue of top 10 Beatles songs. The user then has the choice of which song they would like lyrics for. SongLyrics then makes an api request to the open source api service, lyrics.ovh, based on the user's response. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'song_lyrics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install song_lyrics

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
